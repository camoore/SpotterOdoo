About
============
Currently in odoo users can see all the pricelist with price details. so do you want different restrictions on the pricelist for different users? So here we build a module that can help to display specific pricelist to the user.How did it work? you need to go inside the particular user and select pricelist, which pricelist you want to visible for that user. if you don't give any pricelist than all pricelist will be accessible/visible. supposed you have selected some pricelist than only that selected pricelist will be accessible. wherever the pricelist field of view it will affect to all those fields. Cheers!


Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list. 
5) search module name and hit install button.
